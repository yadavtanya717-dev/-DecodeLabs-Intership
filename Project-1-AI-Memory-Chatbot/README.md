## 📖 Project Overview

The **AI Memory Chatbot** is an intelligent conversational assistant that remembers previous interactions during a session to provide more relevant and contextual responses.

Unlike a basic chatbot, this application stores conversation history locally and sends the previous context to Google's Gemini model, enabling more natural and personalized conversations.

The chatbot features a modern custom interface with a navy blue and beige theme, secure API key management, and cloud deployment using Streamlit Community Cloud.
